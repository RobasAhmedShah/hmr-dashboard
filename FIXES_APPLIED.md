# ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied - Admin Dashboard

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Investment Chart Not Showing**
**Problem**: The chart wasn't fetching real data from the API.

**Solution**:
- Updated `InvestmentChart.js` to fetch from `/investments` API endpoint
- Uses `adminAPI.getInvestments()` to get all investments
- Processes investment data and groups by date
- Shows investment volume over time
- Falls back to sample data if API returns no data
- Added loading and error states

**Result**: Chart now displays real investment data from your backend!

### 2. âœ… **Dark Theme Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: Some parts were showing light colors in dark mode (tooltips, dropdowns, etc.)

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed CSS variables to include `:root.dark` selector
- Updated chart tooltip colors to be theme-aware
- Fixed CartesianGrid, XAxis, and YAxis colors
- Made tooltip background, text, and borders theme-aware
- Used `useTheme()` hook to detect current theme

**Result**: All components now properly display in dark/light themes!

---

### 3. âœ… **Branding Updates**
**Problem**: Dashboard was branded as "HMR Builders" specifically.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Changed sidebar logo from "HMR" to "AD" (Admin)
- Updated company name to "Admin Panel"
- Changed subtitle from "HMR Builders Management" to "Real Estate Management"
- Updated header title to "Admin Panel"

**Result**: Generic admin panel branding!

## How the Investment Chart Works

### Data Flow:
1. **Fetch Data**: Calls `GET /investments` endpoint
2. **Process Data**: Groups investments by date and sums amounts
3. **Display**: Shows as beautiful area chart with dual layers
4. **Update**: Automatically refreshes every 60 seconds

### Chart Features:
- âœ… **Real-time data** from your backend API
- âœ… **Dual gradient layers** for visual appeal
- âœ… **Interactive tooltips** on hover
- âœ… **Theme-aware colors** (adapts to light/dark mode)
- âœ… **Loading state** while fetching
- âœ… **Error handling** with fallback to sample data
- âœ… **Date grouping** for better visualization
- âœ… **Last 30 data points** displayed

### API Integration:
```javascript
// Endpoint: GET /investments
// No parameters needed (gets all investments)
// Response format expected:
{
  "data": {
    "investments": [
      {
        "amount": 1000,
        "investmentDate": "2025-10-20",
        // ... other fields
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
