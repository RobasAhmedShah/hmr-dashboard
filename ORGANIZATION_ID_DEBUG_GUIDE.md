## Issue
Login works, but dashboard shows no data or zeros.

---

## What I Fixed

### 3. **Better Data Parsing** ✅
Improved how we extract data from API responses.

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Clear Cache & Login

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Clear localStorage**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```
3. **Refresh page** (F5)
4. **Login** with your credentials

---

### Step 2: Watch Console During Login

You should see:

```javascript
📋 Fetched organizations from backend: [
  {
    id: "ORG-000014",
    name: "Asaan Builders",  // or whatever the actual name is
    slug: "asaan-builders"
  },
  {
    id: "ORG-000001", 
    name: "HMR Company",  // or whatever the actual name is
    slug: "hmr"
  }
]

🔍 Looking for organization matching: HMR Company

Comparing: {
  backendOrg: { name: "hmr company", slug: "hmr", id: "org-000001" },
  searching: { name: "hmr company", slug: "hmr" }
}

✅ Organization login successful!
📌 Organization ID: ORG-000001
📌 Organization Name: HMR Company
📌 Full user data: {...}
```

---

### Step 3: Watch Console on Dashboard

After login, on the dashboard you should see:

```javascript
🔄 Fetching organization details for ID: ORG-000001
✅ Organization details: {...}

🔄 Fetching transactions for organization ID: ORG-000001
✅ Transactions Response: {
  status: 200,
  data: {
    transactions: [...]
  }
}

🔄 Fetching properties count for organization: ORG-000001
🔄 Fetching users count for organization: ORG-000001
🔄 Fetching investments count for organization: ORG-000001

📊 Dashboard Data Summary: {
  organizationId: "ORG-000001",
  transactions: { count: 25, data: [...] },
  properties: { count: 12, data: [...] },
  users: { count: 47, data: [...] },
  investments: { count: 15, data: [...] }
}

📈 Final Stats: {
  totalUsers: 47,
  totalProperties: 12,
  totalTransactions: 25,
  totalInvestments: 1250000
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Organization Not Matched

**Console shows**:
```
⚠️ Organization not found in backend!
Available organizations: [...]
```

**Solution**: 
The organization name in your credentials doesn't match the backend name.

**Check**:
1. What organizations are returned from backend?
2. What are you searching for?
3. Update credentials to match exact name/slug

**Example Fix**:
If backend has "Asaan Builders" but you're searching for "HMR Company", update:
```javascript
// In OrganizationAuth.js ORGANIZATION_CREDENTIALS
'hmr': {
  organizationName: 'Asaan Builders', // Match backend exactly!
  organizationSlug: 'asaan-builders'   // Match backend exactly!
}
```

---

### Issue 2: Wrong Organization ID Used

**Console shows**:
```
📌 Organization ID: hmr-company  // This is the fallback!
```

**Solution**: 
Not matching backend organization, using fallback ID.

**Should show**:
```
📌 Organization ID: ORG-000001  // Real ID from backend
```

**Fix**: See Issue 1 solution.

---

### Issue 3: Data Not Loading

**Console shows**:
```
❌ Transactions fetch error: Error: Request failed with status code 404
```

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Organization ID is wrong**
   - Check if using real ID (ORG-000001) or fallback (hmr-company)
   - API expects real ID

2. **No data in backend**
   - Organization exists but has no transactions/properties/etc.
   - Check backend directly

3. **API endpoint doesn't exist**
   - If using /organizations/{id}/transactions and it returns 404
   - Check if endpoint is implemented for your organization ID format

## Manual Testing Checklist

### ✅ Before Login:
- [ ] Browser console open (F12)
- [ ] localStorage cleared
- [ ] Page refreshed

### ✅ During Login:
- [ ] See "📋 Fetched organizations from backend"
- [ ] Organizations array has your org
- [ ] See "Comparing:" logs showing matching process
- [ ] See "✅ Organization login successful!"
- [ ] Organization ID is real (ORG-000001, not fallback)

### ✅ On Dashboard:
- [ ] See "🔄 Fetching transactions for organization ID: ORG-000001"
- [ ] See "✅ Transactions Response" (not error)
- [ ] See "📊 Dashboard Data Summary" with counts
- [ ] See "📈 Final Stats" with real numbers

### ✅ In Network Tab:
- [ ] GET /organizations → 200 OK
- [ ] GET /organizations/ORG-000001 → 200 OK
- [ ] GET /organizations/ORG-000001/transactions → 200 OK (or 404 with fallback)

## API Endpoints Being Called

### During Login:
```
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/organizations
```

### On Dashboard:
```
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/organizations/ORG-000001
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/organizations/ORG-000001/transactions
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/organizations/ORG-000001/properties
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/organizations/ORG-000001/users
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/organizations/ORG-000001/investments
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/organizations/ORG-000001/liquidity
```

If any return 404, system falls back to:
```
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/properties?organizationId=ORG-000001
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/admin/users?organizationId=ORG-000001
GET https://hmr-backend.vercel.app/investments?organizationId=ORG-000001
```

}
Comparing: {

## Quick Fix Checklist

If data not showing:

1. **Check Organization ID in Console**
   ```javascript
   // After login, check:
   📌 Organization ID: ???
   
   // Should be: ORG-000001 or ORG-000014
   // NOT: hmr-company or saima-company (these are fallbacks)
   ```

2. **Check Organization Names Match**
   ```javascript
   // Console shows available orgs:
   Available organizations: [
     {name: "Asaan Builders", slug: "asaan-builders", id: "ORG-000014"}
   ]
   
   // Update credentials to match:
   organizationName: 'Asaan Builders'  // Exact match!
   ```

3. **Check Network Responses**
   - All 200 OK? → Data issue (no data in backend)
   - Some 404? → Fallbacks working? Check console
   - All 404? → Wrong organization ID being used
