## Common Issues & Solutions

### If Chart Still Doesn't Show:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for `📊 Processing chart data...` logs
3. Check: `💰 Investments found: X`
4. If X = 0, it's using sample data (which should still show)
5. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

### If Some Components Still White:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear cache and reload
3. Check if `dark` class is on `<html>` element (inspect with F12)

### If Theme Toggle Doesn't Work:
1. Check localStorage in DevTools (Application tab)
2. Should see `theme: "dark"` or `theme: "light"`
3. Try: `localStorage.clear()` in console, then reload
