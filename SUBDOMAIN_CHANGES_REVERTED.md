# Subdomain Changes Reverted ✅

**Date**: October 27, 2025

## What Was Preserved

### ✅ Token Display in InvestmentsManagement
The token display functionality in `InvestmentsManagement.js` was **preserved**. This includes:

```javascript
// Direct token extraction from investment object
let tokens_bought = parseFloat(
  investment.tokensToBuy || 
  investment.tokens_bought || 
  investment.tokens || 
  investment.tokensBought ||
  investment.tokensPurchased ||
  0
);
```

### ✅ USD Currency Display
All currency displays that were changed from PKR to USD have been **preserved**:
- InvestmentsManagement: USD currency formatting
- UsersManagement: USD currency in user financial details modal

### ✅ All Other Functionality
All other existing functionality remains intact:
- User management (CRUD operations)
- Property management (CRUD operations)
- Investment tracking
- Transaction monitoring
- KYC status management
- Status updates
- Filtering and searching

## Current State

The application is now in the **pre-subdomain implementation state** with the following enhancements:

1. ✅ **Tokens Display**: Working - Shows tokens directly from investment data
2. ✅ **Currency**: All displays use USD instead of PKR
3. ✅ **No Organization Filtering**: All admin pages show data for all organizations
4. ✅ **No Subdomain Detection**: Single admin portal for all organizations

## Linter Status

✅ **No linter errors** - All files compile successfully

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Continue working on other features
2. Test the token display in Investments Management
3. Verify USD currency display throughout the application
4. Re-implement multi-tenant features differently if needed in the future

**Note**: If you need to implement organization-based filtering in the future, consider:
- Backend-based filtering with proper API support
- User role-based access control instead of subdomain detection
- Organization selection dropdown in the admin dashboard
